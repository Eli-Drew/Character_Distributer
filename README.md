# Character_Distributer

What it is.
==============================
This is a program that evenly distributes characters in a movie to the people that will be doing a table read. This program requires that characters be ranked by tiers A, B, and C. A being the main characters, B being the supporting characters, and C being the minor roles. This project is new and is just in the idea phase right now. 

What I learned.
==============================
So far, I haven't learned much. It's been good practice though. I've revised it a few times and made it more efficient each time. I will say, I've definitely learned how difficult it is to get a project rolling. 

How it works.
==============================
As of right now, the program requires a text file with the characters ranked by tier and in a certain format (format example at end of this file). You run this Python script from the shell and then follow the prompts. 



Example Text File Format:

Tier A
Harry Potter
Hermione Granger
Ronald Weasley

Tier B
Rubeus Hagrid
Albus Dumbledore
Voldemore

Tier C
